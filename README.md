 **Objective**

To analyze product performance and uncover:

  - Which categories are most profitable

Each product record includes:

  - Category
  - Original Price
  - Selling Price
  - Rating
  - Number of Reviews

---

- **Tasks Performed**

1. Import & Clean the Data

   - Removed duplicates
   - Handled missing values in price, rating, or reviews
   - Properly formatted:
      - Currency columns (₦, \$, etc.)
      - Text and numbers

2. Added Calculated Columns

   - Discount % = (Original Price - Selling Price) / Original Price
   - Review Ratio = Number of Reviews / Rating

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Using Pivot Tables and formulas:

  - Average ratings by category
  - Top 10 products by number of reviews
  - Products with highest discount %

4. Visual Dashboard Created in Excel

  - Bar Chart: Top 10 Best-Reviewed Products
  - Pie Chart: Product Distribution by Category
  - Line Graph: Rating vs. Price Trend
  - KPI Cards:

    - Average Price
    - Average Rating
    - Average Discount %

- **Key Insights**

- Are higher-priced items getting better reviews?
  - "Not necessarily" ,There is a weak correlation between high prices and higher ratings. Many mid-range products received excellent reviews, suggesting value-for-money plays a bigger role than price alone.

- Which category should Amazon promote more?
   - **Electronics and Personal Care** categories had:
       - Higher average review ratings
       - A large number of products with strong review volumes
  - These categories show consistent customer satisfaction and engagement.

- Do higher discounts lead to more reviews?
  - "Partially", Some highly discounted items had a spike in reviews, but others didn’t. This suggests:
     - Discounts might increase product visibility, but
     - Quality and usefulness still determine long-term review volume.

---

- **Recommendations**

  - Focus promotional efforts on categories with high average ratings (e.g., Electronics, Personal Care).
  - Encourage verified reviews on mid-priced products with strong potential they often outperform high-end items in review quality.
  - Monitor the impact of seasonal discounts to evaluate which types of products benefit most from markdowns.
  - Consider bundling products with moderate discounts to boost perceived value and generate more reviews.
